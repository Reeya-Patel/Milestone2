    "We created separate tables for City, Property, Agent, Status, and Listing to organize the data. Instead of storing city and state repeatedly for each property, a City table was created, and each property references it using a foreign key (city_id). Similarly, agent and status information were separated and connected through the Listing table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that there are no partial dependencies and that every non-prime attribute depends fully on its table’s primary key, satisfying 2NF and improving data consistency.\n",
